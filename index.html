    <h2>Co-op Experiences</h2>
    <h3 class="co-op co-op-term">Co-op Term #1: Fall 2020</h3>
    <h4 class="co-op">Siemens DISW, T&I - Advanced Solutions, R&D Developer</h4>
    <p>
      During this co-op with Siemens, I worked on initial stages of a new project, which involved using the Google Glass
      EE2 to help virtualize work in wire harness factories. Some of my tasks included the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted preliminary research into wire harness production & developed a outline of methodology to be used
          with the application</li>
        <li>Developed a sample application for the Glass EE2, using features such as basic UI development, gesture
          features, and object recognition</li>
        <li>Tested usage of ML and object recognition on the glass through TensorFlow models</li>
        <li>Experimented with a wide array of potential applications to be used in the final product of the app</li>
      </ul>
      Some technical and nontechnical skills used during the rotation include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>TensorFlow</li>
        <li>Android Development</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>AR</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Time Efficiency</li>
      </ul>
      The most important technical skill I learned was Android development, as the work I did throughout the semester
      revolved around the Google Glass EE2, making Android development a necessary skill.
      I learned a wide variety of app-creation techniques, which will be a good skill to have in my professional career
      to be a well-rounded developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important nontechnical skill I learned was research, as I needed to set the foundations for our new
      project, requiring many hours of researching potential implementations and use cases.
      This is a very important skill, especially in R&D, to have in any field, and will be a valuable experience for my
      overall research efficiency.
    </p>
    <h3 class="co-op co-op-term">Co-op Term #2: Summer 2021</h3>
    <h4 class="co-op">Siemens DISW, T&I - Advanced Solutions, R&D Developer</h4>
    <p>
      During this co-op with Siemens, I worked on adding new components to our web library, used in a variety of our
      web-based projects. Some components I implemented include a slider, code editor, navigation breadcrumbs, image
      slider, and cards.
      For each of these components, they were both manually tested and automatically tested via tests scripts I wrote to
      ensure the component functionality after updates. Later, I added an additional feature to display code coverage on
      the tests in our library, to measure the effectiveness of our tests.
      Some of my tasks included the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Implement components based on design specifications supplied from the design team into the web library</li>
        <li>Add various functionalities for components beyond standard functionalities available in public libraries
        </li>
        <li>Create tests to ensure correct functionality of components after updates to the codebase</li>
        <li>Use a code coverage measurement script to create a command to display code coverage of tests to evaluate
          effectiveness of said tests</li>
        <li>Maintain components after release, fixing bugs when found by myself or other teammates and add requested
          features</li>
      </ul>
      Some technical and nontechnical skills used during the rotation include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Component Implementation</li>
        <li>Testing & Code Coverage</li>
        <li>Component & Code Maintenance</li>
        <li>Time Efficiency</li>
        <li>Code Conformity & Cleanliness</li>
      </ul>
      The most important technical skill I learned was a combination of the web development languages (JavaScript, HTML,
      CSS). These languages were the only languages that I used throughout the semester, and I became quite proficient
      in them by the end of the term, after starting with little experience.
      These are important skills to have as a full-stack developer, and were some of my favorite languages to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important nontechnical skill I learned was code conformity and cleanliness, as my mentor was very strict
      on code formatting and conformity to the library, to ensure that the library was easy to understand and edit.
      This is a very useful skill to have, not just in coding, but in data management and organization, and refining
      this skill will be very beneficial for future positions and will make me a developer people want to work with.

    <h2>Summative Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have grown tremendously, from a kid who wanted to code just
      because he enjoyed video games, to joining the robotics team in high school and becoming the code captain, and
      finally starting co-ops at one of the most prestigious tech companies in the world.
      I have learned many new skills, particularly from my robotics team, and especially from my co-op terms. Both of
      these experiences not only taught me new skills, such as basic robotics coding, Android development, and web
      development, and allowed me to work with technology I would never be able to work with otherwise, but improved my
      teamwork and leadership teams, and taught me how to be a developer that others want to work with.
      I am very excited to continue to learn new skills and expand my network, and continue to strive to be a developer
      and a person people enjoy working with, and hopefully will be able to use my business skills in a position in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the co-op experience, I have learned new skills much faster than I would otherwise be able to. It has been
      a very positive experience and given me a chance to use the skills I have learned in school in a professional
      environment.
      During my co-ops with Siemens, I have done both Android development with the Google Glass EE2 and web development
      for components in our web library, two areas that I was unfamiliar with before starting to co-op. These have given
      me an invaluable opportunity to learn from professional developers like my mentor, and I have learned much quicker
      than if I was at school.
      Overall, my co-op experience has been very educational for both my technical and nontechnical skill development,
      and allowed me to work with accomplished developers and learn from the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The co-op program has been both fulfilling and affirming for me in my professional career. Before co-oping, I had
      never developed in a professional environment, so being granted the opportunity to do this was very helpful in
      determining that development was the career I wanted to pursue.
      The co-op program was also fulfilling, as I felt that my work actually mattered for the team, and I wasn't just
      given filler tasks. I worked on real projects with my mentors, and was given feedback from both my team and other
      teams for some of them. I am very proud of the work I did during my terms, and I hope to continue this
      high-quality work in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was to start over again, the only thing I would change is to be in-person for my co-ops instead of online. I
      learn much better in a physical environment, so if I wasn't restricted by COVID, I would want to do my terms
      in-person.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my remaining co-op terms, I want to focus on learning new skills each semester. One of my short-term goals is
      to be a full-stack developer, which will require me to have a wide skillset. I do not want to do the same thing in
      any two co-op terms, to continue to expand my knowledge base.
      I also want to expand my network, and try to branch out to create many connections as possible. Networking is an
      incredibly important part of professional development, especially business, and if I want to become a CTO one day,
      I need to create these connections.
